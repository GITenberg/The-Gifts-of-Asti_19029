description: 'Varta, the last priestess of Asti, lives alone with Lur, a telepath
  of the lizardfolk, in Asti''s isolated mountain retreat. Decadent Memphir has long
  since drifted away from the austere paths of Asti, and now the barbarians of Klem
  are sacking the city, and the smoke of its burning drifts up to the temple.   The
  destruction of the human civilization and its humble resurrection, knowledgeable
  evil and naive good, the struggle of good people to gain forgotten knowledge: these
  themes are rich and developed.'
